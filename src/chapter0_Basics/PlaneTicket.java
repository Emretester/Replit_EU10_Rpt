/*

### Given two cities, `miles between the cities`, and a `base ticket price`, and `rate` calculate the ticket price.

#### Formula for price: `base price + miles between cities / rate`

#### Display the details in the following format:

```
	The ticket price from Chicago to Virginia is $dollarAmount
```
Ex:
```
	city 1 -> Chicago
	city 2 -> Virginia
	base ticket price -> 110.50
	miles between cities -> 739.8
  rate: 10

  Output:
    The ticket price from Chicago to Virginia is $184.48
```
