/*

### Use a `switch statement` to create a confirmation bot. Given a `response` value as a `char`, output a message based on the following:

> - if the response is `y` print the message: `Your request is being processed`
> - if the response is `n` print the message: `Thank you for your consideration`
> - if the response is `h` print the message: `Sorry, no live agents are currently available`
> - if the response is anything other than `y, n, or h` print: `Invalid entry, please try again`

Main topics: switch statements, primitive variables

** Example Flows:**
```
Ex:
  Enter command:
  y
  Your request is being processed
```
```
Ex:
  Enter command:
  a
  Invalid entry, please try again
```
```
Ex:
  Enter command:
  n
  Thank you for your consideration
```
