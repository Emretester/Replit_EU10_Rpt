### Use `if statements` to help the student find out which grade level they will join based on their `age`. Use the following information to determine the results:

```
less than 3   -> ineligible
3-4           -> preschool
5             -> kindergarten
6-10          -> elementary school
11-13         -> middle school
14-18         -> high school
19+           -> college
```

#### Hint: Use a multi branch if statement

Main topics: if statements, primitive variables, operators

```
Ex:
  Input:
    8

  Output:
    elementary
```
```
Ex:
  Input:
    5

  Output:
    kindergarten
```
