### Use `if statements` to help the Blackjack dealer determine who won. There will be an `int` `house` value and an `int` `player` value. Use the following rules of blackjack to print out the result:

> - if the `player` score is bigger than `21`, the result is `player bust`
> - if the `player` score is equal to the `house` score, the result is `its a tie`
> - if the `player` score is equal to `21`, the result is `player win`
> - if the `house` score is bigger than the `player` score, the result is `player lose`
> - if the `player` score is bigger than the `house` score, the result is `player win`

#### Note: Can be done with separate if statement or a multi branch if statement

Main topics: if statements, primitive variables, operators
